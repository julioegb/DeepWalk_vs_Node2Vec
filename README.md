# DeepWalk_vs_Node2Vec

This notebook is part of a project on Graph Embedding Techniques. It's a comparison between DeepWalk and Node2Vec using SkipGram applied to a dataset called Github Social Network.

I did several tests with different p and q values for Node2Vec, the last p = 0.25 and q = 0.25 were the ones that gave me the best result.
